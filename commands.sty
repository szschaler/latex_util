% History
% [2004-11-08] Tried to add ntheorem-based support for list of examples and 
%              list of definitions and theorems, but failed utterly. When 
%              writing phd.thm, ntheorem.sty will not expand the caption of the
%              theorem. Because I use local macros to transport the caption 
%              from the keyval parameter to the optional parameter of the 
%              theorem environment, the name of this local variable gets written
%              to phd.thm. When this is read to produce the lists, the name of 
%              the local variable is of course no longer known. Generating 
%              unique global variables has failed, too, so far... So, I have 
%              taken this out again... Ah, I eventually found a solution...
%
% [2004-12-01] Enhanced \part command to allow for some summarizing text on the \part page
%
% [2005-01-13] Added \subsubsubsection and proposition environment
%
% [2006-01-??] Added \insertTwoFigures command
%
% [2006-02-10] Fixed a bug in transmitting position information to the figure environment
%
% [2006-02-20] Added \unskip\nobreak to the end of theorem-style environments
%              This may occasionally require that an empty line is left at the end of such an environment if it is not ended with
%              a list environment and the last paragraph fills the entire line.
%
% [2006-03-09] Added options norelnum and secnum to control numbering of environments for definitions, theorems, examples, and
%              propositions
%
% [2006-03-09] Added option nofancystyle to control page styling
%
% [2006-03-09] Modified definition of environments for definitions, theorems, examples, and propositions to use \renewenvironment
%              instead of \newenvironment to be compatible with other packages.
%
% [2006-03-10] Added twocolumn option to enable special figure commands for twocolumn documents.
%
% [2006-04-30] Added fancyhdr to the list of required packages.
%
% [2006-05-15] Fixed \addexampleline to increase the example counter before writing the theorem line to aux.
%
% [2006-05-15] Fixed \listofdefinitions to include the type of theorem with every entry
%
% [2006-05-17] Added nodrafts option to package.
%
% [2006-05-15] Changed ntheorem usage to using \theoremsymbol for endmark definition.
%
% [2006-08-15] Removed indexing from \termDefine.
%
% [2010-06-15] Added use of cite.sty to sort and compress \cite lists
%
% [2015-04-09] Moved drafts stuff into its own style file.
%
% [2015-04-09] Moved figures stuff into its own style file.
%
% [2015-04-09] Moved theorem stuff into its own style file.
