Some LaTeX helpers...

I have developed these over time and found them useful for various papers etc. that I have been writing. I thought putting them into a repo would a) force me to clean them up a little (let's see how that goes) and b) possibly be of use to others (or not). Last, but not least, I might even learn something from one of the many LaTeX hacks out there.

There goes...
